  <p> Cat ipsum dolor sit amet, find something else more interesting,
      so catty ipsum mesmerizing birds sleep on my human's head.
      <a href= "second-page.html">Hide head under blanket</a> so no one can see
      stares at human while pushing stuff off a table. Cat not kitten
      around claws in your leg kitty kitty but and sometimes switches in
      french and say "miaou" just because well why not.</p>

<h2> Please stop looking at your phone an pet me. Lounge in the doorway
      eat and then sleep on your face meowwww meowwww -- Jeremy</h2>

<h3>THE KITTIES TO GO STORY</h3>

<p> Fall asleep on the washing machine snuggles up to shoulders or knees
    purrs you to sleep. Eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean
    wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then <a href= "#link">retire
    to the warmest spot</a> on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a
    catnap attempt to leap between furniture but woefully miscalibrate and
    bellyflop onto the floor; what's your problem? i meant to do that now i shall
    wash myself intently cough and swat at dog.</p>

<p> Fall over dead (not really but gets sypathy) fooled again thinking the dog
    likes me. Jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy
    run hide in litter box until treats are fed hiss at vacuum cleaner and always
    hungry for lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep stretch.</p>
